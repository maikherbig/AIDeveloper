This tutorial shows how to convert .cif files from ImageStream to .rtdc files and
how to use AIDeveloper and YouLabel to create a dataset and train a CNN model.
There are five steps; the last four steps are explained in a video:


- [Install Java and Python environment](#Install-java-and-python-environment) for converting cif files
- Modify Python script to optimize conversion to .rtdc (see Video)
- Annotate data using [YouLabel]("https://github.com/maikherbig/YouLabel/releases") (see Video)
- Use AIDeveloper to train CNN using Multi-Channel information (see Video)
- Use AIDeveloper to apply model to new data (see Video)
